                <h2>History</h2>
                <div class="about building_picture">
                    Surigao del Sur State University (SDSSU), formerly Surigao del Sur Polytechnic State College (SSPSC), is composed of seven (7) campuses stretching from north to south of the Province of Surigao del Sur with its northernmost campus located in the Municipality of Cantilan and its southernmost campus located in the City of Bislig, with the Main Campus at the center in the City of Tandag. It achieved its status as a university through Republic Act 9998 signed on February 22, 2010 by former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.

                    The history of the University dates back to 1982 when Bukidnon State University (BSU), then Bukidnon State College (BSC), opened its extension in Tandag City known as the Bukidnon External Studies Center (BESC). But this did not last long and after 10 years, the Surigaonuns witnessed the birth of Surigao del Sur Polytechnic College (SSPC) with the signing into law of Republic Act 7377 on April 10, 1992 by the late President Corazon C. Aquino.<br><br>

                    The creation of the Polytechnic College amalgamated the BESC in Tandag City and four (4) DECS-supervised schools in the municipalities of Cagwait, Tagbina, Lianga, and San Miguel (formerly Tago) into one system. Six years later, SSPC earned the status of being a state college by virtue of Republic Act 8628 signed into law on April 23, 1998. This development also led Surigao del Sur Institute of Technology (SSIT) in the Municipality of Cantilan to join the other external campuses under the umbrella of Surigao del Sur Polytechnic State College (SSPSC) further spreading the newly-established state college’s influence and services into the northern part of the Province.

                    Finally, the efforts of pioneering officials, faculty and staff, administrators of the campuses, with the support of LGUs, district representatives of the Province and other stakeholders and the success of its programs eventually led to the conversion of the state-run college finally into a State University in 2010 by virtue of RA 9998.<br><br>

                    Recently, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the University of Southeastern Philippines (USEP) in Davao City allowed for a co-management of USEP Bislig Campus until 2022. This will allow a transition period before the latter’s full integration into the system making it the 7th campus of SDSSU.

                    This expansion policy of the University is showing no sign of slowing down with other public higher education schools or LUCs being worked out for possible integration into the system. But this only manifests the trust and confidence created and cemented by SDSSU with its stakeholders as partners over the years in its quest and pursuit for world-class quality tertiary education for the youth of Surigao del Sur and nearby provinces.

                    These core values are not descriptions of the work we do, nor the strategies we employ to accomplish our University vision. They are the core values that underlie our works and interactions as we internalize responsibilities to fulfill our mission and vision. They are the basic elements of how we go about our work and how we deal with clients and stakeholders, how we mold students to become competent, innovative, globally competitive and service-oriented individuals.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
